### Usage
First of all, import everything that Hue has to offer as follows:

```python
from huepy import *
```

Printing colored text is as simple as doing

```python
print(red('This string is red'))
```

Easy right?
But what if you want to print italic text?
You can simply do this

```python
print(italic('This string is in italic'))
```

You can also combine styles and colors

```python
print(bold(red('This string is bold and red')))
```
